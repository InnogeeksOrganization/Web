    <center><h3>Definition</h3></center>
    <center><p>A galaxy is a huge collection of gas, dust, and billions of stars and their solar systems.A galaxy is held together by gravity. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, also has a supermassive black hole in the middle.</p></center>
    <center><h4>Types</h4></center>
    <center><p>The smallest of galaxies contain a “mere” few hundred million stars while the largest galaxies contain up to one hundred trillion stars! Scientists have been able to segment galaxies into 4 main types: spiral, elliptical, peculiar, and irregular.</p></center>
    <center><h4>Description</h4></center>
    <center><p>galaxy, any of the systems of stars and interstellar matter that make up the universe. Many such assemblages are so enormous that they contain hundreds of billions of stars.

        Nature has provided an immensely varied array of galaxies, ranging from faint, diffuse dwarf objects to brilliant spiral-shaped giants. Virtually all galaxies appear to have been formed soon after the universe began, and they pervade space, even into the depths of the farthest reaches penetrated by powerful modern telescopes. Galaxies usually exist in clusters, some of which in turn are grouped into larger clusters that measure hundreds of millions of light-years across.</p></center>
